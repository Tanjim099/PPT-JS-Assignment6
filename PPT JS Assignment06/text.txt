Q1. What’s Constructor And Its Purpose?
A. A constructor is a special method or function in object-oriented programming languages that is 
used to initialize objects of a class. It is typically called when an instance (object) 
of a class is created or instantiated. The purpose of a constructor is to set the initial state of an 
object by assigning values to its instance variables or properties.

Q2. Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?
A. The JavaScript keyword refers to the object it belongs to. This has different values depending on where it is used. 
In a method, this refers to the owner object and in a function, this refers to the global object.

Q3. What’s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them
A. The call, apply, and bind methods in JavaScript are used to manipulate the execution context of functions. 
They allow you to explicitly set the value of the this keyword within a function and pass arguments to the function. 
Here's a brief explanation of each method and the differences between them

Q4. Explain OOPS ?
A. OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, 
which are instances of classes. OOP focuses on creating reusable and modular code by representing real-world entities as 
objects and defining their behavior and properties through classes.

Q5. Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?
A. Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on representing essential features or 
behavior of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It provides a way to simplify complex systems by breaking them down into 
manageable and understandable components

Q6. Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?
A. Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects 
of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent various types of objects and provides the ability to use 
a single method or operation in different ways depending on the actual object type.

Q7. Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?
A. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (child or derived class) to 
inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent or base class). It enables code reuse and promotes the 
creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

Q8. Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?
A. Encapsulation is a principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that combines data and the methods (or functions) that 
operate on that data into a single unit called an object. It aims to hide the internal implementation details of an object 
and provide a controlled interface to interact with it.

Q9.  Explain Class in JavaScript?
A. In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects with similar characteristics and behaviors. 
It is a syntactical construct introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a more structured and familiar approach 
to object-oriented programming.

Q10. What’s Super Keyword & What it does?
A. In JavaScript, the super keyword is used to call functions on an object's parent or superclass. 
It is commonly used within classes, especially when working with inheritance.
